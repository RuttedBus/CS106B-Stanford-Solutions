This city is so pretty
Under moonlit skies we'll be hanging like a cigarette
So stunning start runnin'
Tonight's like a knife would you cut me with your kiss?

I bleed, red lips you're unbelievable
Can't miss this chance to take you, out
Here's my invitation

Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Take the streets all night 'cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down who's ready to party?
Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Coast to coast I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll we can let go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world

Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

This city was your city
Heels on the sidewalk beggin' for a backbeat
Don't worry I fight dirty
Tonight's like a right hook knock you off your feet

I'll be yours truly unbelievable can't miss this chance to take you, out
Here's your invitation

Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Take the streets all night 'cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down who's ready to party?
Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Coast to coast I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll we can let go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world

Kiss it all goodbye tonight you've never been more alive (You're so alive)
You're not afraid to die and I can see it in your eyes, your eyes

Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Take the streets all night 'cause we sleep all day
When the world comes crashing down who's ready to party?
Hello Brooklyn, Hey LA
Coast to coast I'll take you down in flames
Let the good times roll we can let go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world

London, Tokyo, Boston, Frisco
DC, Chicago, Baltimore, Toronto
(There's a party at the end of the world)
Memphis, Rio, Dublin, Mexico
Paris, here we go
Everybody knows there's a party at the end of the world
